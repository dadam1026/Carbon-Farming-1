Motivation
"Control oil and you control nations; control food and you control people." - Henry Kissinger
        As the population grows, so will the demand for food
        Food and nature emit 14 out of 59 Gigatons of carbon, so sustainable food systems and agricultural practices are needed to ajust what we eat and how we grow our foood
        To curate a tailored, sustainable agricultural practice youe must measure your carbon footprint, analyze your emissions, and execute on meaninful reductions
        
        
This project aims to take time-lapsed, satellite imagery from areas undergoing deforestation across the globe to measure its carbon footprint. First we meaure the % of green land at each timestamp, 1985, 1995, 2005, 2015, and 2020 to conduct cover crop analysis. Next we measure surface roughness at each timestamp to perform conservation tillage verififcation. This monitors soil disturbance which causes the soil's carbon to be released into the atmosphere. Lastly, for the geopgraphic region being analyzed, we use images of the vegetation and livestock unique to that region to further study crop yield, quality, and plant resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses.
